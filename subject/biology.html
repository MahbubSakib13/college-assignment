        <font size="5"> Studying biology provides individuals with a deep understanding of the living world, from the
            microscopic level of cells to the macroscopic level of ecosystems. Here are some of the key things that you
            can learn by studying biology:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Understanding Life:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Biology is the science of life. It teaches you about the characteristics of living
                    organisms, their structure, function, and how they interact with their environments.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cell Biology:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">You'll learn about the fundamental unit of life, the cell, including its structure and
                    function. This forms the basis for understanding more complex biological processes.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Genetics and Heredity:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Biology delves into the principles of inheritance, DNA, genes, and how traits are passed
                    from one generation to the next. It plays a crucial role in areas such as medicine and agriculture.
                </font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Evolution:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">The study of biology involves understanding how species change over time, the mechanisms
                    behind these changes, and the role of natural selection in shaping biodiversity.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Ecology: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Biology teaches you about the relationships between organisms and their environments. It
                    encompasses topics like ecosystems, food chains, and the impact of human activity on the
                    environment.
