        <font size="5"> Studying chemistry provides a deep understanding of the composition, properties, and behavior of
            matter. It's a foundational science that offers a wide range of knowledge and skills. Here's what you can
            learn when you study chemistry:
        </font>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Atomic Structure:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Chemistry introduces you to the structure of atoms, subatomic particles, and the periodic
                    table, helping you understand how elements are organized.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Chemical Reactions:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">You'll learn about chemical reactions, including reaction mechanisms, stoichiometry, and
                    kinetics. This knowledge is essential for understanding how substances transform into new
                    substances.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Chemical Bonding:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Understanding various types of chemical bonds, such as covalent and ionic bonds, is
                    fundamental to understanding how compounds are formed.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Chemical Nomenclature: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Chemistry teaches you how to name and represent chemical compounds systematically, which
                    is crucial for communication in the field.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Chemical Thermodynamics: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">You'll explore concepts like enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy, which describe the
                    energy changes in chemical reactions.
