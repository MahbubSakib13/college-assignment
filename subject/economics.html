        <font size="5"> Studying economics provides individuals with a deep understanding of how societies, businesses,
            and individuals make choices and allocate resources. Here are some of the key things that you can learn by
            studying economics:

        <li>
            <h3>Understanding of Resource Allocation:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">Economics helps you understand how resources, including labor, capital, and natural
                    resources, are allocated and managed to meet the unlimited wants and needs of society.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Supply and Demand: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">You learn about the forces of supply and demand, which determine the prices of goods and
                    services. This is fundamental to both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Market Behavior: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4"> Economics teaches you about market behavior, including how firms compete, how consumers
                    make choices, and how prices are determined in various market structures.
                </font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Opportunity Cost:</h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4">The concept of opportunity cost is central to economics. It's the idea that by choosing
                    one option, you forego the benefits of the next best alternative. This concept is valuable in
                    decision-making, both in personal life and in business.</font>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Economic Models: </h3>
            <p>
                <font size="4"> You'll learn to use economic models to simplify and analyze complex real-world
                    situations. Models help in making predictions, understanding economic phenomena, and formulating
                    policies.
